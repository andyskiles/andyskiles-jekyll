		<p>I&#39;ll save the sop story of my old workflow for later. My workflow is always improving. I&#39;m always looking for a way to make things better and more fun. Designing with a boilerplate is nice, but it can sometimes get monotonous. Here&#39;s how I&#39;m working.</p>

<h2>Jekyll</h2>

<p>I make static sites with Jekyll. It&#39;s the easiest way to add blog-like/cms-like functionality to a site. Additionally, no DB, no problem. It&#39;s a lot more than that, though. Jekyll compiles all my files into a nice _site folder that is ready for deployment.</p>

<h2>Sass</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve modularized my .scss files. This means I&#39;ve got many .scss files. .scss files can get messy quick. That&#39;s my reason for breaking them up. They all get compliled into a signle file I like to call main.scss.</p>

<p>My workflow isn&#39;t perfect here and I&#39;m always tinkering with it, but it works for me.</p>

<h2>Gulp</h2>

<p>I complie, lint, minify, rename, my .scss and .js files with Gulp. Gulp is also nice because it can spin up a webserver, add live reload functionality, and do a lot more things I&#39;m not smart enough to do. Additionally, I&#39;ve configured Ron Swanson&#39;s face to come up with gulp-notify. Whenever my .scss is done compiling, Ron Swanson says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Donuts, Go-nuts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fancy.</p>

<h2>Deployment</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve got my site repo-d on git. I commit my changes and pull from my server. Instant updates. Forever, I was using a GUI to FTP/SFTP/Whatever to upload my sites. Git deployment is exponentially better.</p>

<p>Finding a good workflow is tough, important, and rewarding. At the end of the day, I&#39;ve found a workflow for me that helps me be more efficent, enjoy working, and be organized.  </p>
