Tabbing to see all of the M-x commands in Emacs is fun, rewarding, and overwhelming. Slowly, I've been working my way through them. I'm only on the ones that start with the letter c, and only a few have stuck to memory. 

Perhaps my most favorite command in Emacs yet is:
	
	M-x animate-birthday-present

The birthday present command gives you the ability to create an awesome birthday present for that special someone in your life. You are prompted for the gift receiver's name, then here is a nice animation that runs, and reads out: 

> Happy Birthday, JoeBlow. You are my sunshine, My only sunshine. I'm awful sad that You've moved away. Let's talk together And love more deeply. Please bring back my sunshine to stay!

It's quirky. It's fun. And it can be inappropriate depending on the receiver. It's another reason I'm fascinated with Emacs.
