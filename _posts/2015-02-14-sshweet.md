I've been doing a lot of configuring with my ssh setup recently. Before, it was a mess. I had generated a bunch of ssh keys and didn't have a clue which one was to which. I found out you only really need one, so I deleted them all and made a new one. 

After setting up my config something like:

	Host billybob
		User billybob
		Port 6969
		Hostname billybob.com

I can now ssh into the remote server in Emacs (or terminal) by typing:

	ssh:billybob (Emacs)
	ssh billybob (Terminal)

This beats having to type in: 

	ssh billybob@billybob.com -p 6969

everytime I want to connect to the remote server. I'm still figuring out how to do shell stuff in Emacs, so I'm mostly using:

	C-x d (Dired)

to navigate around the directories on the remote server. Additionally, it feels nice to be able to browse directories, change permissions, and edit files in a single application without a single click of the mouse.
