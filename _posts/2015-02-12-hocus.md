I made the switch to BrowserSync with a couple lines of code in my gulpfile.js and I like it. It's fast, powerful, and has cool features. I tried making the switch months ago, but it never stuck around. 2.0 just came out so I figured why not take it for a ride.

Why BrowserSync is cool:

- Fires up a local webserver
- Fires up an external webserver (connect devices to it)
- Injects CSS
- Injects JS
- Injects HTML
- Syncs scrolling across browser

All of it is pretty seamless. I was expecting a lot of frustration considering I had a nice workflow already. I ran:

	npm install browser-sync --save-dev

and was up and running in no time. Additionally, I added:

	browserSync.reload();

to some of my Gulp tasks for compiling Sass and JS. 

BrowserSync. Fancy.
