Nostalgia is fun. So was my old workflow. I didn't have a worry in the world when building websites, trying out hot, cool table-based layouts and setting px amounts on everything. Time to go back to my roots.

## Text Editor
The text editor of my dreams, weaver. Oh, it can reload the changes I make live!? Groovy.

## .css
One file. Many lines. Lots of scrolling. No problem, I've got CMD-F. 

## .html
Oh, you want to change a header link? Just go through every .html file in the directory and update it. No problem.

## Directory structure
What's the purpose behind having multiple directories when I can put all the files in the same directory. That way, I can see them all when I open the folder. 

## Filezilla
Blazing fast speeds and lockdown security with FTP. Oh, Filezilla added a Yahoo search bar to Internet Explorer? Shibby.

## Shared Hosting
What could go wrong!? They promise security, a GUI for my database, an affiliate program and 99.99% uptime. Sounds like a killer deal for $129/year.

I'm ready to come back from the past.
