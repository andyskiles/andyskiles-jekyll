## Hi, I'm Andy
And I enjoy making things for the Web. 

In 2011, I picked up [CSS3: The Missing Manual](http://www.amazon.com/CSS3-Missing-David-Sawyer-McFarland/dp/1449325947/ref=sr_1_15?ie=UTF8&qid=1423254022&sr=8-15&keywords=html+css) and downloaded Dreamweaver. I breezed through the book in two cram sessions and started my Web career adventure. Since then, I've learned how to build websites, style websites, optimize websites, break websites, fix websites, and use Google efficently.

### Helpful Books
Along the way, I've come across many books that made things, make sense. As I've come to find out, the will to learn is just as important as knowing how to do something. These books have been indispensable to my career.

### Nowadays
Currently, I'm helping local businesses develop their social media presences with my company [Playbook Media](http://www.playbookmedia.co) and making stuff for the Web with [Websuasion] (http://www.websuasion.com).
